        <abstract>
            <t> A number of extensions are proposed in the TLS working group that carry no interesting
                information except the 1-bit indication that a certain optional feature is supported. Such
                extensions take 4 octets each. This document defines a flags extension that can provide such
                indications at an average marginal cost of 1 bit each. More precisely, it provides as many flag
                extensions as needed at 4  + the order of the last set bit divided by 8.</t>

        <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
            <t> Since the publication of TLS 1.3 (<xref target="RFC8446" />) there have been several proposals
                for extensions to this protocol, where the presence of the content-free extension in both the
                ClientHello and either the ServerHello or EncryptedExtensions indicates nothing except either
                support for the optional feature or an intent to use the optional feature. Examples:<list
                style="symbols">
                <t> An extension that allows the server to tell the client that cross-SNI resumption is
                    allowed: <xref target="I-D.sy-tls-resumption-group" />.</t>
                <t> An extension that is used to negotiate support for authentication using both certificates
                    and external PSKs: <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-tls13-cert-with-extern-psk" />.</t>
                <t> The post_handshake_auth extension from the TLS 1.3 base document indicates that the client
                    is willing to perform post-handshake authentication.</t>
            </list></t>
            <t> This document proposes a single extension called tls_flags that can enumerate such flag
                extensions and allowing both client and server to indicate support for optional features in a
                concise way.</t>
            <t> None of the current proposed extensions are such that the server indicates support without the
                client first indicating support. This specification enforces this restriction by specifying 
                in <xref target="rules"/> that server bits may only reflect flags for which the client 
                extension has already indicated support.</t> 
            <section anchor="mustshouldmay" title="Requirements and Other Notation">
                <t> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
                    "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
                    BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174" /> when, and only when, they appear
                    in all capitals, as shown here.</t>
                <t> The term "flag extension" is used to denote an extension where the extension_data field is
                    always zero-length in a particular context, and the presence of the extension denotes
                    either support for some feature or the intent to use that feature.</t>
                <t> The term "flag-type feature" denotes an options TLS 1.3 feature the support for which is
                    negotiated using a flag extension, whether that flag extension is its own extension or a
                    value in the extension defined in this document.</t>

        <section anchor="extension" title="The tls_flags Extension">
            <t>This document defines the following extension code point:</t>
            <figure> 
                <artwork><![CDATA[
   enum {
      ...
      tls_flags(TBD),
      (65535)
   } ExtensionType;
                ]]></artwork>
            </figure>
            <t> This document also defines the data for this extension as a variable-length bit string,
                allowing for the encoding of up to 2040 features.</t>  
            <figure> 
                <artwork><![CDATA[
   struct {
      opaque flags<0..255>;
   } FlagExtensions;
                ]]></artwork>
            </figure>
            <t> The FlagExtensions field 8 flags with each octet, and its length is the minimal length that
                allows it to encode all of the present flags. Within each octet, the bits are packed such that
                the first bit is the LSB and the seventh bit is the MSB. The first octet holds flags 0-7, the
                second octet holds bits 8-15 and so on. For example, if we want to encode only flag 
                number zero, the FlagExtension field will be 1 octet long, that is encoded as follows:</t>
                <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   00000001
                ]]></artwork></figure>
            <t> If we want to encode flags 1 and 5, the field will still be 1 octet long:</t>
                <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   00100010
                ]]></artwork></figure>
            <t> If we want to encode flags 3, 5, and 23, the field will have to be 3 octets long:</t>
                <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   00101000 00000000 10000000
                ]]></artwork></figure>
            <t> An implementation that receives an all-zero value for this extension or a value that contains 
                trailing zero bytes MUST generate a fatal illegal_parameter alert.</t>
            <t> Note that this document does not define any particular bits for this string. That is left to
                the protocol documents such as the ones in the examples from the previous section. Such
                documents will have to define which bit to set to show support, and the order of the bits
                within the bit string shall be enumerated in network order: bit zero is the high-order bit of
                the first octet as the flags field is transmitted.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="rules" title="Rules for The Flags Extension">
            <t> A client that supports this extension and at least one flag extension SHALL send this extension 
                with the flags field having bits set only for those extensions that it intends to set. It MUST 
                NOT send this extension with a length of zero.</t> 
            <t> A server that supports this extension and also supports at least one of the flag-type features
                that use this extension and that were declared by the ClientHello extension SHALL send this
                extension with the intersection of the flags it supports with the flags declared by the client.
                The intersection operation MAY be implemented as a bitwise AND. The server may need to send more than one
                tls_flags extensions, up to one in each of the messages that may carry extensions: ServerHello, 
                EncryptedExtensions, Certificate, and NewSessionTicket.
                It is up to the document for the specific feature to determine whether support should be
                acknowledged in the ServerHello, in the EncryptedExtensions, or in one of the other messages.</t>
            <t> A server MUST NOT indicate support for any flag-type feature not previously indicated by the 
                client. It MUST NOT include this extension in any of the four messages 
                if it has no appropriate flag-type to indicate. This extension MUST NOT be included empty.</t>

        <section anchor="iana" title="IANA Considerations">
            <t> IANA is requested to assign a new value from the TLS ExtensionType Values registry:

            <t> The policy for this shall be "Specification Required" as described in <xref

            <section anchor="ianaexp" title="Guidance for IANA Experts">
                <t> This extension allows up to 2040 flags. However, they are not all the same, because the 
                    length of the extension is determined by the highest set bit.</t>
                <t> We would like to allocate the flags in such a way that the typical extension is as short
                    as possible. The scenario we want to guard against is that in a few years some extension
                    is defined that all implementations need to support and that is assigned a high number
                    because all of the lower numbers have already been allocated. An example of such an 
                    extension is the Renegotiation Indication Extension defined in <xref target="RFC5746"/>.</t>
                <t> For this reason, the IANA experts should allocate the flags as follows:<list style="symbols">
                    <t> Flags 0-7 are reserved for documents coming out of the TLS working group with a specific
                        request to assign a low number.</t>
                    <t> Flags 8-31 are for standards-track documents that the experts believe will see wide 
                        adoption among either all users of TLS or a significant group of TLS users. For example,
                        an extension that will be used by all web clients or all smart objects.</t>
                    <t> Flags 32-63 are for other documents, including experimental, that are likely to see 
                        significant adoption.</t>
                    <t> Flags 64-79 are not to be allocated. They are for reserved for private use.</t>
                    <t> Flags 80-2039 can be used for temporary allocation in experiments, for flags that are
                        likely to see use only in very specific environments, for national and corporate
                        extensions, and as overflow, in case one of the previous categories has been exhausted.</t>

            <t> The extension described in this document provides a more concise way to express data that could
                otherwise be expressed in individual extensions. It does not send in the clear any information
                that would otherwise be sent encrypted, nor vice versa. For this reason this extension is
                neutral as far as security is concerned.</t>
            <t> Extension authors should be aware that acknowledging flags in a tls_flags extension of the 
                ServerHello message exposes this response to passive observers. Unless there is a special 
                reason to place the response in the ServerHello, most flags should go in the EncryptedExtensions
                message.</t>

            <t> The idea for writing this was expressed at the mic during the TLS session at IETF 104 by Eric
