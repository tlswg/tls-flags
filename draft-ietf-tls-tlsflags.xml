        <abstract>
            <t> A number of extensions are proposed in the TLS working group that carry no interesting
                information except the 1-bit indication that a certain optional feature is supported. Such
                extensions take 4 octets each. This document defines a flags extension that can provide such
                indications at an average marginal cost of 1 bit each. More precisely, it provides as many flag
                extensions as needed at 4  + the order of the last set bit divided by 8.</t>

        <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
            <t> Since the publication of TLS 1.3 (<xref target="RFC8446" />) there have been several proposals
                for extensions to this protocol, where the presence of the content-free extension in both the
                ClientHello and either the ServerHello or EncryptedExtensions indicates nothing except either
                support for the optional feature or an intent to use the optional feature. Examples:<list
                style="symbols">
                <t> An extension that allows the server to tell the client that cross-SNI resumption is
                    allowed: <xref target="I-D.sy-tls-resumption-group" />.</t>
                <t> An extension that is used to negotiate support for authentication using both certificates
                    and external PSKs: <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-tls13-cert-with-extern-psk" />.</t>
                <t> The post_handshake_auth extension from the TLS 1.3 base document indicates that the client
                    is willing to perform post-handshake authentication.</t>
            </list></t>
            <t> This document proposes a single extension called tls_flags that can enumerate such flag
                extensions and allowing both client and server to indicate support for optional features in a
                concise way.</t>
            <t> None of the current proposed extensions allow for indication of support in ServerHello (SH), 
                EncryptedExtensions (EE), Certificate (CT), or HelloRetryRequest (HRR) without first being 
                indicated in ClientHello (CH). Similarly, none of the current proposed extensions allow for an
                indication of support in the client-side Certificate (CT) message without first being indicated 
                in the server's CertificateRequest (CR) message. This restriction is enforced by the rules in 
                <xref target="rules"/>.</t>

                    in all capitals, as shown here.</t>
                <t> The term "flag extension" is used to denote an extension where the extension_data field is
                    always zero-length in a particular context, and the presence of the extension denotes
                    either support for some feature or the intent to use that feature.</t>
                <t> The term "flag-type feature" denotes an options TLS 1.3 feature the support for which is
                    negotiated using a flag extension, whether that flag extension is its own extension or a
                    value in the extension defined in this document.</t>

        <section anchor="extension" title="The tls_flags Extension">
            <t>This document defines the following extension code point:</t>
            <figure> 
                <artwork><![CDATA[
   enum {
      ...
      tls_flags(TBD),
      (65535)
   } ExtensionType;
                ]]></artwork>
            </figure>
            <t> This document also defines the data for this extension as a variable-length bit string,
                allowing for the encoding of up to 2040 features.</t>  
            <figure> 
                <artwork><![CDATA[
   struct {
      opaque flags<1..255>;
   } FlagExtensions;
                ]]></artwork>
            </figure>
            <t> The FlagExtensions field contains 8 flags in each octet. The length of the extension is the minimal length that
                allows it to encode all of the present flags. Within each octet, the bits are packed such that
                the first bit is the least significant bit and the eighth bit is the most significant. Using zero-based indexing, the first octet holds flags 0-7, the
                second octet holds bits 8-15 and so on. For example, if we want to encode only flag
                number zero, the FlagExtension field will be 1 octet long, that is encoded as follows:</t>
                <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   00000001
                ]]></artwork></figure>
            <t> If we want to encode flags 1 and 5, the field will still be 1 octet long:</t>
                <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   00100010
                ]]></artwork></figure>
            <t> If we want to encode flags 3, 5, and 23, the field will have to be 3 octets long:</t>
                <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   00101000 00000000 10000000
                ]]></artwork></figure>
            <t> An implementation that receives an all-zero value for this extension or a value that contains 
                trailing zero bytes MUST generate a fatal illegal_parameter alert.</t>
            <t> Note that this document does not define any particular bits for this string. That is left to
                the protocol documents such as the ones in the examples from the previous section. Such
                documents will have to define which bit to set to show support, and the order of the bits
                within the bit string shall be enumerated in network order: bit zero is the high-order bit of
                the first octet as the flags field is transmitted.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="rules" title="Rules for The Flags Extension">
            <t> Any TLS implementation that intends to propose or indicate support for a flag extension SHALL send this
                extension with the relevant bits set.  It MUST NOT send this extension empty -- with a length of zero.</t>
            <t> This specification does not require every flag extension to be acknowledged. Acknowledging a flag extension
                is usually needed to inform the peer proposing the extension that the other side understands and supports
                the extension, but some extensions do not require this acknowledgement. For example, the extension in
                <xref target="I-D.kampanakis-tls-scas-latest" /> allows the peer to send an abbreviated certificate chain.
                The peer need not acknowledge that it supports sending an abbreviated chain. It's enough that it sends 
                the chain abbreviated. It is up to the document defining a particular flag extension to specify whether that
                extension requires an acknowledgement or not.</t>
            <t> Assuming that an acknowledgement is required, it SHOULD come at the earliest possible opportunity. A
                flag proposed by the client in ClientHello (CH) SHOULD be acknowledged in either ServerHello (SH), in 
                EncryptedExtensions (EE), in Certificate (CT), or in HelloRetryRequest (HRR) as the flag document specifies. 
                A flag proposed by the server in the CertificateRequest (CR) message SHOULD be acknowledged in the client's
                Certificate (CT) message. A flag proposed by the server in the NewSessionTicket (NST) message is never 
                acknowledged as there is not client-side response message.</t>
            <t> Multiple flags can be proposed or acknowledged in the same extension.</t>
            <t> In all of the above cases, no flag is ever acknowledged in SH, EE, CT, or HRR without first having been 
                proposed in CH or CR. Unsolicited flags may appear only in CH, CR, and NST.</t>
            <t> A client that supports this extension and at least one flag extension SHALL send this extension 
                with the flags field having bits set only for those extensions that it intends to set. It MUST 
                NOT send this extension with a length of zero.</t> 
            <t> An implementation that receives an invalid tls_flags extension MUST terminate the TLS handshake with a
                fatal illegal_parameter alert.</t>
	    <section anchor="zrtt" title="Interaction with the 0-RTT Handshake">
	        <t> The 0-RTT handshake, defined in section 2.3 of <xref target="RFC8446" />, has a ClientHello message, 
		    a ServerHello message, and an EncryptedExtensions message. Those can include the tls_flags extension
		    just as they can in a regular handshake.</t>
		<t> Future flag extensions MUST define their interaction with 0-RTT, just as other extensions are required to. </t>

            <t> Extension authors should be aware that acknowledging flags in a tls_flags extension of the
